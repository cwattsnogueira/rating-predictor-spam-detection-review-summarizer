Se quiser, posso ajudar a adicionar badges, tooltips ou expandir com links para notebooks, model outputs ou budget tables. Quer que eu monte um bloco completo com isso?


###  Key Insights

- **Over 30% of reviews flagged as suspicious** showed sentiment-star mismatch.
- **Short reviews with extreme positivity** were often promotional.
- **Product name repetition** correlated with fake review likelihood.
- **Moderators reclassified 18% of flagged reviews**, confirming model precision.

###  Next Steps

- Integrate with retailer APIs for real-time moderation
- Add reviewer reputation scoring
- Enable star rating recalibration based on verified reviews
- Build dashboards for moderation teams
