AV16khLE-jtxr-f38VFn,"I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.",55,-0.007174688057040997

AV16khLE-jtxr-f38VFn,"I noticed this product on clearance at a store I shop frequently and decided to give it a try. My husband and I LOVE it! We went back and bought every box left! I, like others have mentioned, am not sure what it is supposed to do other than be a lubricant but for that purpose we like it much better than regular KY Jelly (which tends to dry out and disappear for us). This product stays on for awhile and makes for a very pleasurable experience. The only drawback is that we find it to be a bit sticky. After applying it with your hands you're left with a sticky hand and I agree a little goes a long way! I personally have to be very careful with all products due to skin irritation and surprisingly this actually seems to help that. I did NOT receive a sample and never have.",68,0.07648809523809523

AV1d76w7vKc47QAVhCqn,"yes, the scent is the best. if you like lemon frosting you won't be able to get enough of this lotion. but also, it's almost 100 natural, none of the yucky ingredients like in major brands of lotion. no mineral oil, no petroleum, etc. but also, it completely works. you know how sometimes you opt for organic choices and it's good, but not as good as popular but nastier brands jr watkins delivers. this lotion softens your hands and body, leaves you ungreasy and smells perfect. even my fiance likes it and uses it and he's pretty much anti-lotion in all regards. the price is absolutely right, too--get it!",62,0.42293956043956055

This is a very nice, light-weight cream, that absorbs quickly. It sits so lightly on my skin that I can't feel it and has an ever so slight pleasant scent that dissipates quickly. It does a nice job of moisturizing without resulting in unwanted shine. It's working well for both night-time and day-time use for my aging, sun damaged, somewhat reactive skin. In fact it seems to have a calming effect on my reactive areas. I've been trying many different moisturizers lately - high-end and drug-store brands - and so far this is the best.",63,0.34545454545454546

It's a bit thicker than some products, so it will take longer to absorb fully. The package technology is actually really cool. You push the whole top of the jar down, and a little bit of the cream comes up. It works something like a push-pop. You get just the right amount, and when you get to the last of it, all of the cream is pushed out so that there isn't any wasted being stuck inside the jar. Love that.",49,0.25934981684981684

Inn the past 6 months though we have found that cleaning a window with new paper towels and this product leave a translucent film that makes it look like the window hasn't been cleaned in years. I have personally used it from different bottles and had the same lousy results. It is like there is no ammonia at all in the product and it can no longer cut through whatever is on the windows.

It looked good UNTIL I drove into the sun. WOW! The windshield, according to my wife, looks even worse than before I cleaned it. Not only is it extremely streaky, it is covered with large hazy patches. I will have to try and clean it again. I also cleaned some mirrors around the house. They look pretty good close up. But from across the room, they are all quite streaky. I am sad that the fine product I grew up with has become just another average window cleaner.

I have tried this lotion several times, thinking I was applying it wrong or something. Everytime I use it, It leaves blotches, especially on my arms and chest no matter how much I tried to rub it in evenly. It also took too long to completely dry. If it is not completely dry, you will have lighter spots where your clothes rub your skin or where your arms bend and such. I just cannot stand still for 30 minutes to an hour for the lotion to dry, not touching anything! The color looked pretty orange. It also had a very bad smell after it was left on for a few hours. Also, it washes right off in the shower so don't even think about taking a bath with this because you will be bathing in orange water. The only thing I do like about the lotion is that it gives you color right away and becomes darker over time, but it'd be better if the color wasn't orange.

I got home and read the directions twice before I applied it. I started from bottom to top of my body and got my husband to help with my back just to insure no streaks. As soon as I put it on I was getting the color. And the smell wasn't bad at all. It says to dry completely before you put your clothes back on and to wait 2-3 hours before you get your final color. The 3rd hour came and gone and I could barely tell any difference at all. So I decided to sleep with it on. Got up the next morning and took a shower. The water was Orange and it was so greasy. Took forever for that part to go away. When I got out I looked at my toes and streaks everywhere! I rubbed it off with the towel thinking Itwouldn't come off and I was about to be stuck with orange streaked toes. It came right off.

AV1YtGjdglJLPUi8IOfJ,"I looked online for a great self-tanner and saw this one had a bunch of great reviews, so I decided to buy it, since I am fair skinned and usually cannot get a natural tan. Once I got it, I follwed the instructions just as it said, smoothed the product in very well, and turned out the next day to have streaks and an orangish brown tan. I was really embarrased and got called a tangerine by my friends. I thought the next day i could use it again and maybe it would smooth it out, and it did sorta but still left me with a few streaks and still an orange pigment on my skin. Also if you wanna keep the color then you have to put the lotion on a bunch! Usually after i took a shower most of my orangey tan skin color was gone! It isn't a very good product for the size and quality of it. I used about half of the bottle in less than a week.

AV1YtGjdglJLPUi8IOfJ,"I wanted to tan my legs from sandal area up to my upper thighs. Decided to follow the suggestions, so showered and shaved my legs before using it. After drying off, I applied a moderate amount and applied it with both hands making sure there weren't any areas that had it thicker than others. It worked fine. On one later application, I was rushed so left off shaving until a couple hours after applying this, on the basis that it would be dried off enough. That was a mistake, because along with the little whiskers came a lot of the lotion that had been turned to a gunky consistency. Also, because of the rush I didn't have time to make sure it was applied totally evenly, and ended up with a couple streaks which were embarrassing. As long as you apply this after you have shaved any areas as normal, and then take the time to apply it evenly - even to the point that you gently stroke the area again a few minutes after finishing the application to make sure there are no thick spots left - it works. Take care to not put much at all (if any) on areas of dry or hard skin, such as areas of feet and knees, elbows, etc, because they will end up darker than the rest. This works fine. I think I was right to pick this before a darker tan, and apply a couple times, because it looked much better, much more like a real tan and less like something out of a bottle or tube. The lotion itself made my skin noticeably softer for a few days afterwards, so that was a lovely bonus. I could do without the fragrance, but it's not totally unpleasant.",139,0.09487670068027212

My experience is, if applied after a shower (on dry, un-lotioned skin), and then forego scrubbing skin when showering in daily showers after that (I let the soapy water sluice over to dry and pat dry) your nice tan will fade away evenly and you'll be ready for an re-application in 5-7 days. On the day of re-applicatoin, I will go ahead and scrub my legs with a bath sponge to prepare for an even application. Can you over-apply and end up with splotchiness Yes.

By the way, this can be used anywhere on your body, even your face, and it didn't break me out. I'm very pale naturally, and this is the only one that makes me look NATURALLY tan. The only small flaw is that since you use a good amount of the product, so you don't streak, you go through it rather quickly. But that's just me.

True, the original concept would have made 'purists' happy, but Depp, while acknowledging ALL the built-in comedy, intentionally (I hope) down-plays the humor, making it work even better. Michelle Pfeiffer was WONDERFUL as Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard! Forceful and pragmatic. And beautiful, of course! Helena Bonham-Carter (My FAVORITE Ophelia!) was FANTASTIC as Dr Julia... even down to some of the mannerisms used in the TV show...

AVpe41TqilAPnD_xQH3d,"One might call Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates director Jake Szymanski's feature debut and to a degree I guess that's correct as this is his first film getting a wide theatrical release (and his first that runs over an hour), but Szymanski is no stranger to comedy or the space in which it occupies in Hollywood. In fact, Szymanski turned Andy Samberg's rather thin idea for a 30 for 30 parody into a rather entertaining forty-five minutes last summer. All of this doesn't necessarily mean that Mike and Dave is anything more than one might expect it to be (it's not) and despite sounding like one of those straight to VHS American Pie knock-offs where you might find Tara Reid and the chubby kid from The Sandlot working not-so hard to earn a paycheck, Mike and Dave actually delivers on the promises and premise that have been set up in its marketing. Though it might seem obvious that 20th Century Fox would like to make something of a comedic brand out of Mike and Dave (Mike & Dave Go to London, Mike and Dave Take the World) it somewhat feels as if Szymanski and writers Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien feel the opposite. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is very much a contained story that gives our main cast of characters defined arcs that take them from one clear point in their lives to the next. What is nice about what both the writers and Szymanski do though is that they don't allow this transformative period to completely define these characters. The titular siblings are still very much who they were in the beginning of the movie at the end of the movie save for the fact they've learned a few lessons and earned some perspective. What I'm saying is that Mike and Dave doesn't turn into a fable of some kind where the intent of the film is to teach its characters and audience a lesson, but rather is more about the challenges and obstacles presented in a certain situation and how a specific type of person deals in the messes they've made. This is undoubtedly the films strongest trait in that it doesn't become wholly what we expect though it is mostly the obtrusive and familiar raunchy comedy you hoped it would be if you bought a ticket in the first place. That said, Mike and Dave delivers some modest pleasures for, despite largely adhering to the beats of the genre, it excels in hitting those beats through a likable and appealing cast.",229,0.12547268907563028

AVpe4-GPLJeJML43xmuY,"Progresso had a Meatball and Rice soup last year (2015) that Target carried in the Bay Area and I loved it, kept going back to purchase larger and larger quantities when I ran out. Then the weather got hot and I stopped buying soup. With winter again, I wanted that soup and couldn't find it anywhere. I was so happy when I found that Target.com had it and purchased more than a dozen cans. Much to my surprise, it's not the same recipe! The soup I had last year was tomato based and only had meatballs. This soup is also tomato based, I think. I couldn't quite tell because of how much oregano was in it. And it had chunks of chicken and bits of corn. It tastes so different from the soup from last year! I've decided to donate the rest of my cans to a food bank for the holidays and hope that someone else will like it more than me. Target.com had great prices and the delivery was incredibly fast. The cans of soup were wrapped in heavy duty plastic bags, somewhat wasteful but definitely helpful to prevent spills should any cans unexpectedly get punctured or damaged, although none were damaged. Too bad the plastic bags had some tiny holes in them, otherwise I could have put them to other uses as pet waste pick-up, oh well. So, overall, the soup was a disappointment but the buying experience was good.",124,0.06874999999999999

AVpe59io1cnluZ0-ZgDU,"My family and I absolutely love the first one. Seen it maybe 8+ times and still cracks me up. That said, after watching the 2nd one, we all thought is was a major let down. The humor was pushed and not natural. Used the grandmother way too much, and each time it wasn't funny, but was ridiculous. And this will be weird saying, but everything was too ""Greek"". Yes, we understand that the family is 100% Greek, but the movie made them out to be absolute idiots (their homes especially). In the last move, Toula ended up being a very strong character, but she is back to being frumpy again at the beginning of the 2nd movie and having to find herself again. The list goes on and on and there are just too many reasons to skip this movie.

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"My husband and I use Pantene products regularly. This was our first time however, trying Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. Personally, I was not a fan of this product right from the start. I did not like the scent at all. It has a peculiar medicinal-like smell to it which put me off immediately. Also, I found that these products (both the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner) were too rich for my fine hair oily scalp. My hair was left lifeless, with no volume and unmanageable. I make an effort not to wash my colour-treated hair everyday to maintain the colour longer. This certainly is not possible with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. By the second day after using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was greasy, flat and smelled bad. Since this product was not right for me, I decided to pass it on to my husband who reports back to me that he likes Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner and will likely continue buying it.

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"BzzAgent offered to send me Pantene Pro-V shampoo and conditioner. I chose the Age Defy as the claim stated on the bottle is that it instantly restores youthful vitality. Sounded great, right When I received the bottle I noted that it stated 7 signs of aging hair: (1) breakage (2) split ends (3) frizz (4) unruly greys (5) lackluster colour (6) thin look (7) dryness My hair definitely suffers from breakage and split ends, and there are indeed a few unruly greys...perhaps a little more every day. The other issues weren't really a concern for me, but since it was sent to me for free I figured I'd give it a go. I was intrigued by the bottle. It didn't match it's shampoo sister. Instead of being tall and thin, it was almost conical, with the opening at the bottom. Very smart design as it allows the viscous product to settle down at the spout, and thus render it easier to squeeze out of the bottle. I also liked that the plastic was malleable, making it easy to dispense product. I was surprised that there was only 237mL of product in the condition, compared to the 285mL of shampoo since most folks tend to use more conditioner than shampoo. Like the shampoo, the conditioner has that typical Pantene scent, which I find pleasant and not overwhelming. It has a thick and creamy consistency which spreads easily over the hair strands, and combs through nicely withinthe shower. I always use both shampoo and conditioner so it is difficult to comment on how the conditioner works on its own. I can say that my hair felt silky smooth, which I suspect is due to the presence of silicone in the conditioner. My hair smelled great, but there wasn't any noticeable change. I still had breakage and I still had split ends, and my greys were just as unruly as they had been. All in all, I'm rating this conditioner 3 out of 5 starts. In my mind, it is pretty average. My hair felt smooth, but it became oddly subject to static electricity which I had not experienced prior. Like its shampoo sister, it left my hair smelling pleasant, but I hope most conditioners would do so. I would not go out of my way to pick up another bottle, but I would certainly use it again if it were provided to me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",199,0.1939935064935065
AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"As a conditioner, the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy did not perform any better or worse than any other Pantene conditioner and the scent was nice. If I accidentally used too much, before the end of the day my hair would look greasy and stringy. Applied just to the ends and it left too many tangles to comb out. A full-sized bottle lasted almost an entire month and while I don't have super thick hair, I do have long hair and I wash and condition it daily. Overall, I would not spend the extra money to buy the Expert Pro-V line. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",56,0.10641025641025639
AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"While I was disappointed with the Age defy shampoo from Pantene, the conditioner definitely ranks higher. The bottle design is great, and I am able to get every last bit of of it. The new design is definitely a plus. The scent is lovely too. Not over powering, but stays with me throughout the day. I have thin fine hair that falls below my shoulders, and a small dollop covers from root to tip. The coverage is great. Rinsing it out is easy, without the buildup or taking extra time to rinse. My hair feels softer, even when still damp. My brush goes through smoothly without much tugging or struggling required. I do notice I still have some flyaways after drying. It's still soft and supple though, which is nice. I will say, it didn't really meet all of the claims for Age Defy. However, I am definitely going to try the different Pantene products with the hope that age defy just want the right choice for my hair type.

Some conditioners are watery and runny. it lathers up really well and then washes out completely without leaving any residue that can weigh hair down. My biggest issues are aging hair, including unruly greys, lackluster dyed hair and dry hair. My hair is also naturally wavy and can get really frizzy, especially in the dry, cold Canadian winters. This conditioner addresses all these issues. My hair is soft and manageable and feels moisturized and well nourished. My scalp is not dry or itchy. My hair has a lot of bounce and movement in it. It is bright and shiny and healthy. It is now more like my 19 year old daughter's hair. I like this product and will continue to use it.

It didn't do anything miraculous, like prevent those suckers from growing in the first place, but it did keep the wiry hairs from sticking up like a beacon of my impending old age. Another surprising quality was that it detailed my hair nicely. A brush would just glide through, even when wet. Finally, as a girl who only washes her hair 2 to 3 times a week, this conditioner kept it from getting too oily too soon. Unfortunately it did dry out my scalp, or perhaps that was the shampoo's fault. I would not repurchase this product as it contains too many ingredients that I can't pronounce, however, I will keep what's left in the bottle and use it once a monthwhen my hair needs extra detangling, or when those nasty gray hairs pop up and need a little taming.

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"I reviewed Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner through BzzAgent, these opinions are my own. Following on the heels of another hair product that left my hair quite dry, I was a bit nervous that this too would leave my hair wanting but I was pleasantly surprised. The shampoo seems to be really gentle and fortifying and the conditioner adds new moisture and shine with lots of body to boot. The scent is pleasant and light and not noticeable in my scent free workplace. I believe that this product can Defy age as well as the environment, heated hair appliances and all the rough stuff that life throws at our hair. Additionally, I found that while using Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner, my usually mischievous and unruly hair, really behaved nicely, it seemed calmer, more relaxed. This is a product that I will certainly continue to use and recommend to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",89,0.18337971552257265
AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"About 18 months ago my hair started to look damage. I had never given much thought to my hair. I had never had problems with it. I thought the damage was due to stress and my hair dresser agreed. I have tried so many different products during this last year and 1/2 with nothing helping. After starting to use Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner I have really noticed a change. Now when I feel my hair it feels silky and doesn't feel brittle. Before I was afraid to brush it or blow dry it too much, now I can't wait to style it and show it off!! Can't say enough about the change in my hair since changing to the AgeDefy Conditioner!!

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Shampoo and Conditioner Thanks to BzzAgent and Pantene, Im trying this product for free!! First impressions mean everything! When I opened up my kit I immediately noticed the new sleeker bottle design. The slender black bottle has a no-fuss appeal and a higher end look and feel to it. Next came the scentAMAZING! It has an expensive salon smell, definitely not what I'd expect from a product you can buy at the drugstore. I have very thick long curly hair and finding a shampoo and conditioner that works for me is tough, to say the least. Lately, my hair has been showing the tell-tale signs of aging, dry, brittle, breakage, split ends, pesky gray hairs that pop up and scream 'YOOHOO, LOOK AT ME!' and, of course, dreaded FRIZZ. The biggest issues for me are all of the above so I was excited about trying out a product that claimed to be concocted to tackle all of my hair woes. So lets do it!! I've used this product for a little more than two weeks now and so far I'm thrilled. The shampoo has a thick and lasting lather. I could almost feel my hair getting thicker as I worked the lather through my hair. I was anxious to see how the conditioner would stack up. The thick creamy consistency is exactly what you want out of a conditioner. I worked the thick cream through my tangled mass of curls and then I waited a few minutes before rinsing. Wow! Huge impact! Manageable and easy to untangle, my hair looks and feels so soft and silky and the breakage issue is well on its way to being non-existent. Then theres the gray hair issue, they are now blended into my hair and not sticking up. I actually had to look for graysso much less noticeable! Damaged aging hair is no longer the first thing I see in the mirror. I would highly recommend it to friends and family and I will definitely continue using Pantene Pro-V Age Defy.

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"I'm absolutely changing my hair care routine to include Pantene's Age Defy Shampoo Conditioner! Since I've started using them (about 2 months ago), I've noticed the look AND feel of my hair change dramatically. It's softer, easier to manage there's no residue left from the shampoo/conditioner. You can visibly see the differences as well - my hair doesn't have those frizzies it's healthier looking (has a beautiful shine). I'm really impressed! Another huge benefit is that I don't need as much conditioner (you can really tell the quality) as other brands I've tried. If you have hair issues, you MUST give Pantene's Age Defy a try!!

The conditioner comes in a sleek bottle and the scent is the same as the AgeDefy shampoo (pineapple coconut like). Although the colour of the conditioner is pretty bland and unappealing (reminds me of cement paste), it does the job and leaves my hair smooth and soft and silky! No tangles or knots for me! I'm very happy with how the AgeDefy line is keeping my flyaway grey hairs in check (at least 80 better than before I tried this product). Would definitely buy this in the future.

I had to immediately open it up and get a good wiff of it to get an idea of what my hair will smell like. You know what I'm talking about! Had to smell the conditioner too, mmm smells soo yummy! Smells coconutty, like suntan lotion! The following day I had plans to meet up with my mom for lunch. The day of my lunch plans, that morning, I grabbed my towel, my Pantene Pro-V AgeDefy shampooconditioner. Got water to temp and wet hair. Squeezed nickel size amount of shampoo as I have long hair. Lathered shampoo into hair and the amount was plenty enough for my head. It rinsed out so clean, it actually squeaked! Next I used the conditioner, same amount as I used with the shampoo which was plenty enough to saturate my hair and scalp. After rinsing all the conditioner out, wrapped hair in towel to soak up excess water! After removing towel and towel dried hair I looked at hair it looked so shiny. It felt so clean and light! Most conditioners don't rinse out clean and your hair feels heavy and afterwards my hair looks greasy! Brushing it was so easy, so smooth and silky! No knots to fight with and loosing a handful of hair. I blow dried my hair and OMG, it felt even lighter! Wasn't sure if I had hair on my head! LOL! It was light and fluffy. Felt like I had just got out of my hairstylist chair! My hair flowed with the wind, it felt so good!

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"I had not been a huge fan of too many Pantene products in the past so I was a bit skeptical about this new formulation but man was I wrong! Pantene's new Pro-V age defy Conditioner formula is wonderful, I absolutely love it, they got it right this time!! I found that it was a very moisturizing formula without adding any heavy residue. My friends I absolutely loved the way my hair looked. I definitely got LOTS of compliments! I loved the shininess and bounce and when I touched it it was sooooo soft. My hair also smelled amazing, the perfume was similar to that of a brand that is very expensive and people thought that's what I was using! I was very impressed, especially because the great results seen were after the first use( i.e results were immediate).

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"Ok, so what goes with a great shampoo...but a great conditioner! I tired the Pantene Exper ProV AgeDefy Conditioner. The conditioner claims to fight the seven signs of aging: 1. Breakage, 2. Split Ends, 3. Frizz, 4. Unruly Greys, 5. Lackluster, 6. Think Look, and 7. Dryness. Once again the company delivers on what they are promoting with the conditioner. It has helped my hair to regain the shine, tame the fly aways, and help with the split ends, breakage, and to make my hair look fuller. Now what I did find with this conditioner is if I didn't use it every day my hair was built up with static. I like to be able to use conditioner every other day or every two days. So this was a bit of a disappointment to me that I would get static in my hair because I didn't use the conditioner. So if you are someone who doesn't use the conditioner every day, maybe take this into consideration. Thanks BzzAgent for the campagine.

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the smell of the product. It smells crisp and refreshing. The best thing about it is that it lasts for a while too - my husband told me my hair smelled good and I was on day 3 hair! When testing a conditioner, I look for 2 things: 1 is how slick it feels in my hair and 2 is if/how much it weighs down my hair. I have very fine and thin hair so any extra weight is a big no no! This conditioner is quite thick in consistency but blends into the hair surprisingly well. It gives just the right amount of slickness to allow me to de-tangle my hair with my fingers only, without feeling like I'm pulling too much or causing any damage. It rinses out well and my hair doesn't feel weighed down once I blow dry it. This condition in combination with the Age Defy shampoo has been my go to combo in the past few weeks.

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,"Today I tested out the Pantene Pro-V Age Defy conditioner. As I had reported in my review of the matching shampoo (Age Defy), I was a little hesitant at first to use this line as I did not have good experiences with some of Pantene's other shampoos and conditioners. I found some of Pantene's other conditioners to have too strong a scent (and not a pleasant scent in my opinion), as well as weighing my hair down. Just like it's matching shampoo, the Age Defy conditioner had a pleasant smell that was not strong at all. With my fine hair, the conditioner gave my hair some nice volume and bounce. It did not weigh my hair down. My hair looks smooth, not frizzy. My scalp isn't dry or greasy after using it.

After using the age defy conditioner I can confidently say that my hair feels younger, softer, so shiny and alive. It made my hair a lot more shiny and bouncy, no more dullness. I have very thick and long hair and it is hard to find something that works this well in terms of keeping it looking fresh. I used the conditioner similar to a hair mask and left it in for a few minutes before washing out and it definitely made a difference in its productivity.

I put conditioner on my hair, and then I tend to other things, like shaving or brushing my teeth. A lot of other conditioners end up running down my face (yikes) or drips into my eyes (ouch) or completely rinsing out of my hair without me ever touching it (boo). Not this stuff. It smells phenomenal, and is soooooo silky. It makes a big difference in blow drying my hair too. I have fine, dry, broken hair.

I also love how the container is a tube that stands on its cap so the product is always available to be squeezed out. It rinses out without leaving a heavy residue and in the two months using it, my hair always feels strong and full of volume.

I have severe trouble with frizz and this helped much more than other conditioners. It claims to fight the seven signs of aging hair, but my hair has only 3 of these: frizz, unruly grays and dryness.

AVpe5s3RLJeJML43x4eA,I think this is one of the best conditioners I have used out side of a salon. When using this product I compared it to a salon product that I had been using.

After washing it then using the conditioner and drying my hair I had less fly aways and very little frizz in my normal day. I am very pleased with this product and I wouldn't leave it on the shelf at the store.

AVpe6n2_LJeJML43yOgE,"I have had dry frizzy hair for 30 years and tried many products that have failed. Before I tried this, I was using Tresemme's Smooth Silky sham/cond plus applying 3x the recommended amount of a leave in salon super skinny serum. It was the best I could find, but on some days it just frizzed and looked bad. Then I tried this product and was immediately impressed with performance. My hair was smooth and soft and very manageable. I finally have the soft, healthy looking straight hair I have always wnted. When I put my hair into a ponytail it looks a lot smoother than before. The odor of this product is difficult to deal with the first few days. It smells like cheap hairspray or cheap cologne trying to cover up an even worse smell.. The first time I used it my teenage daughter asked me to crack the window of the car so she didn't have to smell it. But over time we got used to it. I shampoo almost daily and I am now on my 4th bottle of each, shampoo and conditioner, and have consistently had great results. (I still use the super skinny serum).",100,0.20869565217391303

I washed my hair and applied the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Conditioner. I could tell as soon as I had this conditioner in my hands that it was different from anything else I have EVER tried in the past which includes other brands of Keratin shampoos, conditioners treatments. I've tried Wen, Biolage - everything and nothing has come close to this product. I don't what's in this stuff but I love it! It's extremely rich, emollient and it felt VERY SILKY. I have Lupus and I wasn't feeling well so I skipped the leave in products that I normally have to cover my hair with to control the frizz and get a little softness. I fell asleep with my hair still damp. When I awoke I could not believe it was MY hair on my head! I was stunned at how soft, silky and healthy looking this conditioner left MY hair. I kept saying to my self ''this can't be MY hair!. I never have soft hair, NEVER!

Now when I read it on the bottle that it helps with detangling, I wasn't really expecting it to work on my hair type. But it litterAly produced miracles. It has a good slip to it, I did notice that it's best when the hair is wet. When it's wet I didn't have to use much of the product to get it to detangle. 2. I decided to leave it in as a deep conditioner for about and hour, so it can feel condition my hair. When I rinsed it out my hair was litterAly the softest I've ever felt it, ( given I had just risned it out and it had no product in it at all). The conditioner made my hair feel clean and mosturied. And just healthy. Idk it's like you know when something is just right for your hair and this was it for me. 3. I didn't have any problem with my scalp as mentioned in the other reviews. But I've never had that problem with any products. 4. On the bottle it mention friz control, I didn't see a huge difference in that buuut considering my hair type I didn't expect to. 5.

AVpe6n2_LJeJML43yOgE,"Most that give negative reviews fail to mention personal hair texture and scalp sensitivity. 1) keratin treatment isn't for everyday usage. If you use it everyday or every other day it may make your hair brittle (which will cause breakage). Try to wash and condition your hair no earlier than 6 weeks from initial usages (this goes for any keratin or kertain infused treatment is based off your own hair texture). 2) if you have sensitive scalp consult with a professional, they may recommend a different brand. However, a sensitive scalp may get away with using the conditioner only. Keep in mind that a keratin treatment is for straighten and/or loosening curls excessive usage is the same as over processing hair with dye, relaxers, perms, etc. Keep another shampoo and conditioner handy for your normal routine.",80,-0.028571428571428564

It makes wonderful lemon icebox pies without worrying about all those fat calories in the filling, makes a great hot fudge sauce and many other items.

AVpe8dHWLJeJML43y4uG,"My review is based on apartment living. Not sure how the sound may carry in bigger homes, however in a small single family home I think the sound will still travel loudly. I received this as a house warming gift from my registry about 2 years ago. I had 2 purposes in mind when I listed them, safety to alert me if my then 4 year old tried to open the doors (I strongly recommend for single parents if you don't have a second pair of eyes to keep on your young child while showering or even if just in a back room), and security because we are living in a ground floor apartment. It has a chime ring or the option for loud squelching. I keep it on the loud squelching. It is so loud, there is no way that anyone inside of the home can't hear it. It's been two years and I have not had to change the batteries yet. The picture being used for the advertisement is about how far they can separate from each other before the alarm is triggered. Just very recently, we experienced a scare where someone had picked my patio lock and tried to enter our home. This definitely scared them away once the alarm was triggered.",99,0.14202380952380955

AVpe8gsILJeJML43y6Ed,Limited uses. Product is not good if using multiple full size sheets of paper. Would be good for receipts and things like that. Good that small things won't fall through the bottom of the folder. Folder sections don't expand with the rest of the file folder for thicker files. The major flaw is how thin the file folder is. I use file folders to protect other papers - I want something that will hold up to a lot of handling and tossing on the car seat or on the desk.

AVpe8gsILJeJML43y6Ed,"Useful for documents of different sizes or types such as receipts, account information, recipes, project ideas, etc. Each section can hold letter size paper if organizing by type.

Main tab is 5 wide for long single line description and about 1/2 lower are inner tabs which are 2 wide. Also each section itself has room for labels, notes, or even attached items in addition to tab space. These are not heavy weight paper but adhesive labels on tabs will make them sturdier. Sections won't hold high volume of pages but pages can be placed on top of the sections for higher volume (same fold lines as standard folder).

AVpe8gsILJeJML43y6Ed,"Up until today, I didn't realize this product existed... And that's really too bad. Bought these on a whim during checkout and I am thoroughly pleased. I do a lot of papercraft, as well as creative writing, and I've always wished for a folder-ish system where I could organize various documents, templates and various bric-a-brac for a project, especially one that could handle a variety of different sized pieces that will, eventually, constitute a whole. This fits the bill - now, instead of just throwing all the various pieces, of vastly differing sizes and shapes, for a papercraft project in a stack with a binder clip, I can logically lay them out in the product's sub-folders. YES!!! While I am overall very pleased with the product, a few pieces of constructive criticism presented themselves while I was familiarizing myself with these new folders: 1) The covers feel very flimsy when compared with the side of the folder with the pockets. Because of the extra layers on the pocket side, it is much beefier, and, sometimes when I pick a full folder up, the cover pops open and documents can slide out. 2) It would be great to have a few different interior layouts of the product - sometimes when working with a lot of small pieces, seeing as how they would lend themselves to the lowest, smallest pocket, get jumbled up and confused. having a few different pocket layouts could help remedy this. 3) It would be great if the folders came in other dimensions, besides just the standard 8.5x11 size. I work with a lot of over-sized pieces of posterboard and it would be really nice to have folders to help organize them as well. A smaller, pocket-sized version would be very useful as well. 4) This final one is purely cosmetic - the folders come in only three colors. For project management purposes, having seven or eight (or more) different colors would help me keep the folders organized one color per project. Overall, I am very pleased with the product, and, if the need arises, I would absolutely purchase more packs.",180,0.13825439266615738

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,I had the vacuum for 2 weeks before there was a problem with the electrical. There were spark-type flashes coming from the base and then it just stopped any suction and would not work.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"Nice vacuum cleaner, if you DON'T have thick pile carpeting. Beater bar does not automatically adjust as stated. Vacuum shuts down automatically on thick pile, high quality carpet. I don't recommend. This is major flaw.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"There were things to like about the Hoover, but enough things to not like that I returned it after a week. -I like automatic height adjustment, but it is done poorly on this vacuum it does not lower enough to fluff up the carpet. I think it is because the small height wheels are in front of the beater bar and keep it too high off the ground. The small wheels on my old Oreck were behind the beater bar so it got closer to the carpet. The vacuum has very good suction, but the carpet does not have that nice fluffy look after vacuuming. -The vacuum is light weight, but poor ergonomics made using it a chore. It hurt my shoulder and neck every time I used it. I also noticed I was much more tired after vacuuming my house with the Hoover than with my other vacuum. -The power cord is nice and long, but of very poor lightweight quality. It frequently made knots of itself, and I would have to stop, go over to it, and unwind the knots. I also ran over the cord once...if you did that many times, your cord will be eaten up. -The furniture guard did not work well...it left a scuff in some molding. I wanted to like the vacuum, as it seemed a good update to an Oreck. It had nice controls, a full bag light, and has good suction. But I ended up returning it as it doesn't fluff up the carpet, didn't seem to get up dog hair as well, and it's poor ergonomics made using it a chore.",129,0.09119791666666666
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I just replaced my fairly new 9lb hoover light and clean lightweight vacuum that I absolutely loved with the new lightweight platinum. My mother wanted my hoover 9lb so I needed to buy another hoover lightweight. The platinum is 12lbs and is a fantastic vacuum if only you could turn the roller brush off (I couldn't on my other hoover lightweight) and if there was a true auto height adjustment that would raise it high enough to do my modern fashion shag rug and bath mats (again, I couldn't on my other hoover lightweight). I've had it for a week but think I will return it for the reasons stated above. The new platinum lightweight weights 3lbs more than my previous hoover lightweight and it does not do anymore than my previous one. For me, it was a waste of money.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"We've gone through numerous vacuums and all seem to have some type of downside. The Hoover Platinum UH30010COM seems to have the best blend of features and value that we have experienced. The two vacuum design (one standup and one portable) is a great convenience and optimization of features. This allows the upright to be very light (at 11 lbs it is almost 50 lighter than most uprights). The portable is very convenient for tight spaces and especially the stairs. My wife used to dangerously use the hose attachment from our old upright on the stairs. Also I believe the bagged design is superior to a bagless design. The bag is huge and provides a much cleaner sanitary disposal of collected dust and carpet fibers. The one drawback is that the upright can be hard to push on densely packed carpet. To be fair, many vacuums have the same issue. Our Eureka vacuum is impossible to push. This Hoover is difficult to push on some of our carpets but is still acceptable. If it wasn't for this we would give it a 5 star rating.",94,0.17612781954887222

I can vacuum the whole house and not feel tired. It cleans quite well on carpet, but fairly well on hardwood. It picks up most stuff on hardwood, but it does tend to send some hard dirt flying across the room (and that is on the low setting). It is quite noisy, but i dont mind that too much. The bags are pretty big. I still have not had to replace the one i got with the hoover. BUT the bags are difficult to find and quite expensive. I tried to buy from the hoover website but they were always out of stock. i dont understand how the manufacturers can be out of stock for months. The canister has very good suction. Noisy but thats ok. It is a little awkward to use, and to store. You have to wind the cord around the canister and just let the hose lie next to it. No place to put the attachments, so you have to store that separately, which is annoying bcoz you have to go and get it every time you want to change attachments. But basically, both the upright and canister are good vacuums.",106,0.09526515151515151

I immediately had to take it for a test drive once we got it home. The old vacuum had left so much behind that by the time I got done I had to change the bag. For those that give low ratings because they can't find the bag...I have found the bags at other stores. Since that intial use with the vacuum...I haven't had to change the bag again.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I just read some reviews about the handle breaking on these vacuums and I wonder if people are lifting their vacuum and carrying it around incorrectly. There is a carry handle on the vacuum and it should only be lifted with that. I always lift my Hoover via its carry handle, not the handle used when operating the machine, and after owning this Hoover for several years now I have to say it has never given me any grief. It is lightweight and easy to use and the only thing I have to do occasionally is adjust the bag when the red warning light comes on notifying me that the bag is full when in reality, it isn't. Sometimes this happens within a couple days of installing a new bag so I know it cannot possibly need changing. I figured out what was happening and it is cat hair clogging the upper part of the bag. If I have a lot of cat hair to clean up this can happen because the hair does not fall to the bottom of the bag like normal weight debris will...instead, it gets sucked into the bag and stays right there at the top and after a few days of that happening, the change bag warning light comes on because the cat hair stuck at the top of the bag makes the machine think the bag is full.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I wanted a bagged vacuum that was lightweight without compromising on features or breaking the bank. I did a lot of research and found this Hoover upright with separate canister. I liked the idea of a separate canister that I could pull out for little jobs or for vacuuming the car. I already own a (heavy) Hoover upright with all tools on board. My style of vacuuming is to grab the hose extender and tools to do those jobs as I go along - alternating between floor vacuuming and dusting. So, the new vacuum means that I have to change my habit - a minor concession that I am happy to make. I like this vacuum. It really is lightweight with controls right where you expect them. I like having the headlight (something you do not get with inexpensive and/or lightweight vacuums). Both the upright and the canister have lots of suction. I noticed right away that debris within a couple of inches of the nozzle was sucked right in. That told me that anything under the head was getting totally sucked in. The canister gives me so much freedom that I forget that it is wired and eventually I get out of range of the cord length and get pulled back to reality (it has a long electrical cord). Overall, for my money, this was a very good purchase. I don't like to vacuum but this vacuum makes the job easy. So that I don't leave anything out, here is a list of things I like about this vacuum: Lightweight Big debris bag Serious suction Long cord on both units Headlight Only as noisy as necessary Separate Canister for dusting or small jobs Intuitive control placements (on/off switch, tilt pedal) Well-placed handles Upright unit will lie down flat for vacuuming stairs and under furniture Easy to maneuver Narrow nozzle allows cleaning in tight spaces Full bag indicator (I have not seen this)",170,0.09502328479601208

I bought it mostly just to use upstairs as we have heavy carpet and two long-haired pets, as well as a toddler. It definitly makes me feel like that carpet is finally clean of dust and hair. Our sniffles and sneezes every morning have stopped, and I'm sure this vacuum is the reason. It's rated 2 by Consumer Reports, don't waste your money on others.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"Scenario: three story house with a variety of floor coverings from hardwood and ceramic to wall-to-wall carpet. Required: an upright with a headlight, HEPA bags and no extra attachments or hoses - just give me a vacuum that cleans carpets well. Have a nice little canister vac for smooth floors. To be avoided: Canister vacs with carpet attachments and uprights with floor attachment. All horrible machines, they do nothing well. And bag-less Whoever thought up that idea needs a brain check. What a mess to empty and then all the filters to wash or replace....who needs it This vacuum was exactly what I wanted: light-weight, had a headlight and used HEPA bags. I shopped like crazy and nothing else seemed to fit the bill. Even though I didn't need the extra canister vac I decided to go ahead and buy the combo. Review: The upright is amazing: long enough cord, easy to carry up and down stairs, fingertip controls. It cleans carpets exceptionally well. And it looks pretty fabulous too, a bit like a butler in a tux. (I can dream can't I) The surprise extra was the little canister, it's a blast to use! No bashing walls and flipping over. It also uses HEPA bags. Another well-mannered machine that performs above and beyond the expected!

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I love this vacuum! It is wonderful and does a great job - especially for those with allergies! It works well on pet fur, dirt and sand up. I have been professionally cleaning houses for ten years and have used a wide variety of different makes and models or all levels and qualities - including uprights and pull-behinds, oreks, hoovers, electrolux, etc etc. THIS COMPARES VERY HIGHLY to the Orek which is three times the price. The little hand-held buddy as separate unit is easier to use than having an upright with a detachable hose (which never quite gives as much suction when it is constantly removed, reattached, removed, reattached, and so on - it just isn't a tight seal. This upright is easy to manuver and is smart enough to do varying levels (no need to stop and readjust the floor level) and can do hard floor surfaces just as well as carpets. It has not once scratched a wood floor or laminate and I tend to run through the entire hose with the upright and only use the hand-vac for edges and corners. The little hand-held is like a souped-up dust-buster! Unfortunately it has a very loud high pitched noise while running, but I think the great suction is the pay-off. Also I wish the little hand-held had the same light feature that the upright has. It helps you see cob-webs that would've otherwise been missed. Being honest, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MODEL - and the only downfalls I can see are expensive HEPA filter replacement bags (but therein you are getting all pollens, dust, mold spores, etc that would've been left behind otherwise) AND the bottom of the upright unit needs to unscrewed and cleaned out regularly. This is common on any beater-bar when things wrap around it, however I notice that this model gets pet fur clogged up the air-shaft more than some others. It is easy to fix (just 5 or 10 minutes once a month or every other) to unscrew four screws - clean it out well - and replace screws. They walk you through it on the hoover support line if you need help. This helps if the check bag light comes on even though its a fairly new bag you know its not really full. Like I said, I own a cleaning business, so I have recommended this to at least a dozen customers who were due for new vacuums and all have been equally happy with price and quality.",210,0.13710687229437232
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"We have used the Hoover Platinum Collection Lightweight Bagged Upright Vacuum UH30010COM and the portable canister unit SH10000 that comes with it for about 10 days.

So far, both the upright and the portable canister have performed admirably. The upright is powerful yet light, around 12 pounds the lightness is important because we have 40 steps to carry it up and down. The upright also cleans the edge of a wall-to-wall carpet all the way to where it meets the baseboard - something no other vacuum I have owned has been able to do, a terrific feature. The portable canister is handy for cleaning less accessible places that are awkward for the upright (e.g., around windows, sliding door tracks, under the refrigerator). You can use the upright to clean carpeted stairs if your wish - the handle folds down 90 degrees so it is even with the stair treads and there is a convenient handle on the body of the upright that helps you in cleaning stairs.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I find the Hoover Platinum bagged vacuum to be a nice combination (upright plus hand-carry). As many others have said, the upright is very light compared to my old Hoover upright Windtunnel. It is much quieter, particularly over plush carpet, and the two handles work well to guide the upright for carpeted stair cleaning. I was surprised at how well the upright fluffed up our plush carpets, particularly on stairs (makes them look like new). The rubber wheels roll quietly on hard floors, and don't mark. The hand-held vacuum is also light and easy to carry. Contrary to some reviewers, I did not find it particularly loud and the vacuum strength is adequate for cleaning corners and upholstery. One gripe is that there is no height adjustment on the upright, which makes it hard to push on plush rugs (very easy on hard floors and berber carpets). To counter this, I run the upright on low to reduce the vacuum strength which in turn makes pushing the vacuum easier. Gripe two is that the beater brush does not stop spinning when the upright is in the locked, upright position. I don't use the upright on hardwood floors, so this is not a big issue for me.

The cord of the caniter unit is several feet long, so it is long enough to stretch acroos at least half of my living room to get the job done. A bagged canister is hard to find, too.

Cons: (1) if using with a loose pile carpet, the roller spin is strong enough to unravel carpet on the high setting, especially at carpet seams. This is not an issue when using the vacuum on the low setting. I've used oreck before but have not tested dyson, and the quality of this vacuum is significantly better than oreck.

I thought the days of buying a vacuum that lasted 20 years were over, but this machine feels so solid I can actually see it lasting that long. It reminds my of my mother's old green hoover that she used forever, except that it's a whole lot lighter and the floor actually looks clean after using it. The canister is also very lightweight with good suction. But it's really not very thoughtfully designed. There's no good way to store the tools and no place to wind up the cord, so it's pretty unwieldy to get out and put away. Luckily I don't use it all that much. It's a shame that the folks at Hoover didn't take the time to put the same thoughtfulness into the design of the canister.",112,0.18033333333333332
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,I was chosen to participate in a case study with this vacuum through a site called Cafemom. I fell in love with this product. I have a zoo in my house and it can get rather hairy. It picks up the hair with no issues and is easy to push around. Hi and low settings for different parts of the house and also has an indicator letting you know when to change your bags. The second little gadget that goes with it is easy to cart around and helps with getting gunk off the edges around the baseboards.,47,0.14635416666666667
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I did a lot of research on vacuums before purchasing this one and I love it. The price was good and the vacuum works great. It is easy is get into tight spots, picks up great and it is so nice not to have to adjust it for carpet or tile floors. It adjusts itself. I also love the portable vacuum that comes with it. Before I had to lug my big vacuum to clean my baseboards and now I have a handy, compact vacuum that is easy to carry around. The extra long handle is wonderful and my husband loves it for vacuuming the car. I am so glad that I found this vacuum. Thanks Walmart for having the best price!!",54,0.35491718426501034
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I did a lot of research before I bought this vacuum, and I'm glad I did. It has turned out to not only meet, but exceed my expectations. The best things about this vacuum are the excellent suction, low noise, light weight, and the HEPA filtering...not to mention the 35-foot cord. I was a bit disappointed that the upright itself did not accommodate the crevice and upholstrey tools, but have really grown to like the separate cansiter vac that you strap onto your shoulders. It's also lightweight and does a good job cleaning. Some people here have complained about the price of the replacement bags, but shop around online. You can get the bags relatively cheaply on A*****. And the bags last longer than my other bags did in my old Eureka Boss, which I had to change when they were only half-full to assure the best suction. Plus, they are HEPA filtered.",72,0.2822222222222222
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I read the MANY glowing reviews on this vacuum (lotsa sites!), and figured they must be Hoover shills- NOT! Fun vacuuming... Yea, sure- It's TRUE!- I vacuumed til 2am first time (I couldn't believe my eyes!)! My old CG Top-Rated 4.5hp canister would fluff up packed hallway... carpet (surface only!), but would quickly pack right back down. :o( The Hoover goes MUCH deeper (must go perpendicular/both ways..., or floats at higher side carpet level!), removed TONS of old dog hair, and REALLY deep fluffed up my carpet! After walking on it for two-weeks, my carpet is still fluffy! WOW! It was a pain on packed stairs (no more!), but worth it (sucks good when locked upright!)! Cons- The portable hand vacuum that comes with is a WEAK JOKE (one star, as they don't have zero!)!- I'll keep my powerful canister vac for the tools, as NO vacuum I've found cleans all the way to the edge (right side is close)! Sound Too Good to be true- Well Wally World has a liberal in-store return policy (even when purchased online!)! I guarantee you'll be AMAZED at the performance, and long warranty (you definitely get what you pay for!)! Scott :o)",124,0.15337941628264207

Nevertheless, we bought another, that makes seven now in our possession however I must say that the Platinum vacuum by Hoover is the best engineered for the money I have ever seen.

AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"In tough economic times it was a bit difficult to spend this much money on a vacuum but my house requires the best vacuum out there to deal with the fur from 3 cats and big dog and two daughters with long hair! This vacuum gets everything, it truly works edge to edge. I can clean right up into the corners without having to switch to the hose feature. It has rubber wheels instead of plastic which are so much more durable and much easier on my wood floors. The true test was whether I could clean cat litter without feeling it spraying out behind the vacuum...a huge success! It's so easy to use and comes with a 6 year warranty. A GREAT vacuum whose weight allows me to carry it up and down the stairs easily.",73,0.1810213940648723
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I am a mom, homemaker and professional maid by trade. I have had this Hoover for 3 years and it runs as good as the day I purchased it! The wheels are fine and not flimsy at all. This vacuum, by far, outperforms the Oreck on cleaning and suction. Also the Oreck has left black marks on my customers carpets when the supposedly superior wheels get a little milage under them, and I have had more problems with the belts on the Oreck then the Hoover. The canister that comes with it is great as well. Nice long cord. Use it to on hardwood and tile before mopping to clean up dog hair, food, and debris and, of course, the stairs. Very easy to change the bag with a nice feature that keeps the dust from flying everywhere when you remove the bag (Oreck does not have this). Also a light takes the guess work out of when to change the bag. There is a convienent handle on the back of the vacuum that makes it extremely easy to carry up and down the stairs, and the canister has an adjustable and comfortable carrying strap. While cleaning floors with the canister the best way to wear this is with the strap all the way extended and across your body instead of hanging off your shoulder, that way you are free to move quickly and you won't have it slipping off your shoulder and dropping to the floor. I love this Hoover, in my opinion it was worth every cent and I am going to purchase another one to keep on the second floor.",124,0.29861111111111116

So, I wanted bagged vacuum this time, but I wanted to touch it before buying. Local vacuum store had price range $500 and up. I was not ready to pay this much. Luckily, I found reviews for this model and decided to go for it. I can't say enough how happy I'm with it! It's light, it has features of all those expensive staff I tried in store and saw on Youtube but for the right price. That is why I decided to write this review. It helped me, hope it'll help someone else!",60,0.14876984126984125
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I am so very happy with my purchase. I wanted a bagged, light weight vacuum, and this is perfect. Great suction power, and my carpets look practically new when I'm done vacuuming (and they are almost 10 years old). The canister vac (also bagged) was a welcome bonus. So easy to use, and no more lugging around a heavy bagless vacuum that has to be emptied every time it is used. Got it on sale, so that made me even happier. I would definitely recommend this combo for anyone who prefers bagged over bagless and wants something light weight enough to carry up and down stairs if needed. And which does a good job on hardwood floors, too!",63,0.347064393939394
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"We bought this because my wife's old Royal vacuum is so heavy and hard to use. It also needs some repair to the handle latch.This Hoover is much easier to use and it does an even better job. We were concerned that there was no height adjustment, but this works equally well on carpet, hardwood, and vinyl floors. The handle for stairs is especially useful, as we have two carpeted stairways. The vacuum is so light it isn't a problem.In spite of the bad reviews on the canister, my wife loves it too. It is so very light it is easy to vacuum out the cars, and the long wands reach to the high ceiling on our back porch. It seems to have a lot of suction, and the noise is no worse than any other vacuum.We definitely wanted a bag vacuum, as emptying a no-bag vacuum is a messy operation. With the bag, you just remove all the dirt and dust and it is already bagged. Also, the bag offers a very large HEPA filter that is changed automatically when you need to change it. In one step you neatly empty the dirt and replace the filter.",96,0.044971428571428565
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"First, a disclaimer of sorts ���. I���m a long-term, died-in-the-wool Hoover evangelist. No, I don���t work for Hoover, but I���ve used Hoovers religiously for 30 years. I���ve tried switching off to other top-of-the-line brands, but always returned to Hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability.That does not, however, mean they were perfect.��� The Hoover WindTunnel U6439 bagged upright that I���ve had for the last several years would suck up a Buick. Unfortunately, it also rivaled a Buick in the weight category. Although it���s supposedly a ���self-propelled��� model, I felt like I had to go into training in order to vacuum my house. It became something I would put off because I wasn���t sure I had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house.��� The WindTunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual, hard-to-move levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them.��� The HEPA filter on my old WindTunnel seemed to work only for the first few months. After that, all manner of airborne particles would fly around as I vacuumed, even after I cleaned/replaced the filters.��� Lastly, noise of my previous WindTunnel was something akin to a jet taking off.When I saw a TV commercial for the Hoover Platinum series machines, I was definitely intrigued. I loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price (brilliant marketing idea there, Hoover). But I was skeptical; could the power of a Hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds? I���d tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at best.I made a beeline for the Internet to start researching. Over a couple of days of intensive reading, I decided to continue my trust in Hoover and took the plunge.Both machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when I got home from work. The first thing I noticed was that I could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a Sumo wrestler��� that was promising. After removing everything, I was stunned at the weight ��� or lack thereof ��� for both machines.The physical appearance is very appealing; the upright is sleek and slim with a 35��� long cord, and the canister has tools-on-board, along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can ���wear it��� while you vacuum. You will be stunned by how little these machines weigh ��� a child could easily lift them both. But could they clean?When I fired up the Platinum upright, the word that kept coming out of my mouth was WOW. First off, no more jets taking off in my living room ��� just a pleasing HUM. Second, this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term self-propelled. It seemingly FLOATED over my carpeting all on its own, while still having the suck-up-a-Buick power I expected from a Hoover. It cleaned better in one pass than its older U6439 WindTunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes. I was picking up stuff I didn���t even know was there. Whether vacuuming underneath your bed, or behind that dresser that you haven���t moved since you moved in 15 years ago, it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one pass.I have a rather large, bulky throw rug in my kitchen that I had been preparing to replace because it had become so un-vacuum-able in recent weeks. The Platinum upright made it look brand new. And hallelujah for a TRUE edge cleaner! Everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights, but this one truly delivers on the promise. Think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers ��� like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor. This Platinum upright sucked up all that debris ��� right to the edge.The maneuverability of the Platinum upright is astonishing. It truly is as light as Hoover claims and it moves as easily as a Dyson. The upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease. It also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent, lighted, fingertip control right up there on the handle.The HEPA filtration is light-years ahead of my previous WindTunnel ��� think HEPA with a Hemi under the hood. Yes, I know that bags are expensive, but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk. I don���t mind paying for a product that truly works ��� these bags, and this new Platinum HEPA filtration system, truly work. No dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywhere.The Platinum canister has a carrying strap, which makes so much sense. The folks who clean my office building uses strap-on canister vacuums and I always ���what an intelligent design��� ��� now, I���ve got my own. And all the tools are right there attached to the unit, ready and waiting for you. I toted that canister all over the house, cleaning window sills, ceiling corners, air conditioning vents, everything! Then I walked into the garage and cleaned the inside of my SUV. It���s quiet, powerful and incredibly portable ��� the best ���canister��� I���ve ever used.In my first test run of this Hoover Platinum ���vacuum system,��� I found myself LOOKING for stuff to clean; I couldn���t get enough of it. The Hoover UH30010COM Platinum is, quite simply, the best vacuum PERIOD I���ve ever owned. I absolutely LOVE this machine ��� and to get 2 vacuums ��� an upright and a canister ��� for the same price just makes terrific economic sense. It has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet, sleek, lightweight package that doesn���t leave me feeling deaf, sore and exhausted. Bravo, Hoover!",553,0.1648011363636364
AVpe9W4D1cnluZ0-avf0,"I was on the fence about this vac, but once i unpackaged it, and put it together w one screw, I was allready intrigued, then as soon as I hit the power button, i was sold..the brush roll and height adjustmnt is auto, grooming the carpet as well as cleaning it, I like the groomed carpet look, and the color came back some to the carpet as well after several passes, so I knew the old vac, heavy and cumbersome wasnt working well at all, the canister is packed w power and easy to use w the shoulder strap making access to the tools easier than ever.

AVpf0thK1cnluZ0-r8vR,"The 100 is a post apocalyptic sci-fi offering that has many elements typical of the genre. We start off about 100 years after the surface of the Earth was destroyed in an atomic war. Thirteen nations have orbital space stations and when the thirteenth is destroyed a truce is eventually called and the remaining station unite physically forming the Ark, what is presumed to be the last remnant of the human race. The Ark has a very dysfunction society were all crimes are punished by execution (floated out of an airlock). Juvenile offenders are reviewed at age of 18 and may be spared. Out story opens with Clarke being taken out of juvenile detention to be sent to Earth to see if the planet can support life, since the Ark is dying. Many elements of the first few episodes borrow from the Lord of the Flies and other science fiction works. The 100 find out in a matter of a few episodes that they are indeed not alone on the planet and the situation worsens on the Ark when over 300 people are ""removed from the life support grid"" which is polite language for them to be killed to allow the remaining people to live. The culling was voluntary but along with the political fighting that was shown and death of likable main characters revealed a very dark undertone at times in the series. The dark undertone was similar to Stargate Universe. We are left at the end of the season with the remnants of the 100 being taken to what appears to be a surviving military bunker. The ending of the first season has a deja vu appearance similar to Jeremiah season one. Overall a good sci-fi effort but only combines elements already seen in the genre with no new ground breaking plot or story lines so far. Look forward to season two.

AVpf0thK1cnluZ0-r8vR,"The 100 is like a fine wine: it's a show that only gets better with age. Although the first few episodes seem like typical CW-fare, the emotional stakes and characters continue to develop with each subsequent episode. The story beings when 100 juvenile delinquents are sent down from their space station to the war torn earth, to see if it is inhabitable many years after a nuclear apocalypse. Questions of morality, survival, sacrifice, and cultural politics are the central themes in the first season, and continue on for the rest of the show. The 100 dares to ask questions that other shows are too scared to even acknowledge. It's worth your time, for sure.In my opinion, the blu-ray release is the way to watch this show.

AVpf0thK1cnluZ0-r8vR,"I don't understand the varied reviews of this show. The ""100"" are juvenile delinquents released from their space station prison sentences to populate a radiated earth: earth is most likely not habitable. But down they go, and when they get to earth they not only experience a ""planet"" for the first time, but they also have just been released from prison. So imagine, 100 irresponsible criminals get dropped on an earth that hasn't seen a human in 97 years; you might expect to see some strange behavior and you do. The setting is pretty awesome, the characters are interesting and unless the writers completely drop the ball on the story, then you can expect a pretty good show. Also note, all the bad reviews have come from people who have just seen a single episode (who's expectations were probably unrealistic in the first place). This is one of the better pilots I have seen.",77,0.1392857142857143

Morgan Freeman gives us his usual likable best. Helen Mirren wields an assortment of guns. And Mary-Louise Parker shows us how facial expressions and muffled sounds can turn a story line and spice up a story.There's not a single member of Willis's reunited team I wouldn't like to be around.

AVpf2tw1ilAPnD_xjflC,"Red is great popcorn fun that I think you will enjoy. The movie stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, and very funny John Malkovich. The movie is directed by Robert Schwentke, who previously directed The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan. The plot of the movie Frank (Bruce Willis is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah Mary-Louis Parker). Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous. I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. Thank you for reading my review",108,0.03263888888888888

So, I grabbed my Ziploc full of wipes, hopped right into a porta-potty no line, score!, wiped down the door handle first then the seat, gave it a minute to dry and BAM, I'm good to go. Not only did I get back before my friends had even gotten a stall, but I got to use a CLEAN toilet where as they had to do the squat and shuffle! Needless to say, they opted to use the porta-potty the next time around and they stopped making fun of me for being a clean freak....who's laughing now!!!
