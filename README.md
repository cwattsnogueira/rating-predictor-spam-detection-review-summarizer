##  Navigation & Dependencies

Each module includes:
-  A technical `README.md`
-  Jupyter/Colab notebooks in `notebook/`
-  Outputs in `output/`
-  Colab links and reusable artifacts

Modules are designed to run sequentially, with outputs from one step feeding into the next.

##  Getting Started

1. Begin with [01 - Data Loader](./01-data-loader-review-clean/) to load and clean raw review data.
2. Follow the numbered folders to explore the full pipeline.
3. Refer to each moduleâ€™s README for technical details and Colab links.
4. For business context, explore the [docs-business](./docs-business/) folder.
